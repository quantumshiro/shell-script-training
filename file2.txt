A recent approach which may lead to some really good low cost
applications is that taken by Andrew Davison.  His MonoSLAM system
uses a single camera to detect and track a sparse number of landmark
features, and also plot their position within a 3D map.  It's an
interesting way of doing things because it involves forming a closed
loop between the mapping and the feature detection.  Individual
features are detected and inserted into the map, but then the map is
also used to very specifically search for and re-acquire previously
observed features.  Another nice feature of the system is that the
camera can be freely moved in any manner - it's not restricted to only
moving in certain ways (such as pan/tilt directions) - which means
that it could potentially be attached to a robot having any degree of
mechanical complexity.

Davison's system presently only works on Linux, so I've done a Windows
version rewritten using Visual C# 2005 in order to do some
experiments.
