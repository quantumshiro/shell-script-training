The ability to both recognise landmarks and to accurately estimate
your own movement through space is traditionally one of the more
difficult problems in robotics.  Usually this kind of thing is done
using laser scanners or other high precision optics which are much too
expensive to become practical consumer products, and also contain
moving parts which could potentially fail during the rough-and-tumble
of robotic life.
